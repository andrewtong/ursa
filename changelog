v1.1

Changes from v1.0 to v1.1
Letter swapping between strings is now performed correctly

Minimum partition length when splitting the string pattern is going to be the of length n, where n is the length of the
substring.  This is important because it allows the program to check for words that have two instances of the same letter
accurately (e.x. firefighter) without returning a imperfect score.
